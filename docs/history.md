## Eminent chess players

**Mr. E. B. Hussey**

"It is more than ynar ago since received a communication from the well-known Leeds player, Mr. E. B. Hussey. We are pleased therefore to find from the Peterborough Express the following account his recent chess exploits, coupled with those of an older date ia Leeds and Yorkshire: A well-deserved compliment has just been paid Mr. E. B. V. Hussey the Peterborough Chess Club. Mr. Hussey is probably the greatest expert of the game in the city, and he has been created honorary life member the club in recognition, of his eminent services in many ways, and especially in raising the standard of play among the members. The honour was conferred with hearty unanimity on the proposition of Mr. Cholerton, seconded Mr. S. Shrive. Mr. Hussey was for some years honorary serrertary the Leeds and Yorkshire Chess Clubs, and on severing his connection with them received Staunton set of ivory chessmen as a memento the members’ regard and appreciation. He has played in inter-county matches with nearly half the counties of the three kingdoms, and in many other important contests. That Mr. Hussey’s skill at the great intellectual recreation has not abated is evident from the fact that during August Bank Holiday week accepted fifty-five challenges his dub, and won every game!"

Peterborough Standard, Friday 08 November 1929, AN OLD AND POPULAR TRADESMAN. ---*-- Death of Mr. Samuel Shrive, of Peterborough. , MEMORIES OF THE GOLD DIGGINGS. Many of the citizens of Peterborough I feel a deep sense of less in the death of Mr. Samuel Shrive. "Abbotsford," Park, road, who might be termed Grand Old Man of the city. His demise occurred suddenly. Whilst listening-in to a broadcast, lecture on Saturday evening he complained of soddenly feeling unwell, and his medical advisor, Dr. J. Filcher, was called. After a time he appeared to be in less pain. awl the doctor left. However, he became worse. and though Dr. Filcher was hastily . i again, Mr. Shrive passed away ' about Mr. Shrive, who was 88, had lived a very full and varied life. A son of the late Mr. and Mr.. John Shrive, he was born in a hamlet near Finedon, and when he was quite yoeng parents moved to Stonepit Lodge, between U'ootlnewton anti ',other' inghay. There he spent the whole of his I boyhood, being educated at Berridge's'.. School. Among his contemporaries at that scholastic institution were such well-known men as the late Alderman John Tebbutt and the lute Mr. Thomas Stokes, of War- mington. In Mr. Shrive came to Peterborough. was apprenticed by Mr. William Thompson, of Bridge-street, whose premises occupied the site where Messrs. Shrive and Son's establishment now stands. Later he joined Mr. Searjeant, whose business he worked with the late Alderman Daniel Redhead!. Later Mr. Joseph Searjeant took over the business, and took Mr. Redhead in partnership with him. As a young man of twenty. Mr. Shrive turned. his attention to the then rapidly developing British colonies in the Far East. He decided to try his luck in New Zealand, and sailed from England in one of the oldtime wind-jammers. The journey took three months. awl Mr. Shrive hue often told how he whiled away many weary booms with his beloved set of chess-men. When he landed in Dunedin he had to sell his chess set and even his pipe and tobacco to pay hie quota fees. Those were the days of the gold erase in New Zealand, and Mr. Shrive joined the beetle rush northward across South Island to Hokitika—in those days it settlement of worden huts. To-day Hokitika is in.. of the five I great cities of South Island. Ile made the , journey on foot and by pack horee, and often had to cut his way through dense thickets. Mr. Shrive was among the hundreds of prospectors who flocked to the gold fields and staked their claims, hut he not ; the luck to he among the few to "make , their pile." lie next turned his attention cattle ranching, and many are the tale* I he told of the exciting days of his stock-riding. BACK TO THE HOMELAND. 1 After a time he decided to return to the Motherland for a holiday, but he was destined never to return to New Zealand. In England he met and married Miss Prior, of Brandon, Norfolk, and decided , that he would settle in Peterborough.He purchased the business of his one-time employer, Mr. Thompson. In a short time the business developed to remarkable proportions, and Mr. Shrive was one of the city's best known butchers. With two others he instrumental in forming the Peterborough District Butchers' Association, and was appointed treasurer. That office he held for a great many years, until, on amount of his advancing age, he reluctantly decided to sever his connection with the association five years ago. In conjunction with the late Mr. Henry Hare and Mr. Burlingham, he founded the Peterborough Chess Club quite 40 years ago. He held principal offices in that society, and came to be known as one of the best exponents of chess in Northamptonshire. He often represented the county in important matches. He was a well-kpown figure at the Church Institute, and it was his custom to visit the games room about six in the evening, arrange the chess-men on the board, and then sit patiently smoking his pipe, waiting for the victim to appear!
